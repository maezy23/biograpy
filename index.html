                <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
                <p>
                    If you had told me at 13 where I would be today, I might have found it hard to believe.<sup>1</sup> 
                    Growing up, life was often confusing and didn’t look like the usual story I imagined.<sup>2</sup> 
                    I’ve always tried to stay happy, even when things felt uncertain.<sup>3</sup> 
                    Most of the time, I lived at my father’s house, but it was really my grandparents who helped raise me.<sup>4</sup> 
                    At first, this unusual family setup was hard to accept, especially when I saw friends with more typical families.<sup>5</sup> 
                    My parents weren’t married, and my mom visited sometimes, so I also spent time at her place, where my other grandmother lives.<sup>6</sup> 
                    Even though my family was different from others, it was still full of love in its own special way.<sup>7</sup> 
                    My grandmother taught me early how to be independent, which wasn’t always easy because sometimes I felt like I had no one to fully rely on.<sup>8</sup> 
                    But that independence became a strong part of me.<sup>9</sup> 
                    Over time, I started to understand why my life had been like this, and even though it wasn’t simple, it taught me important lessons about staying strong.<sup>10</sup> 
                    I learned that staying positive, even when things look different or hard, really helps.<sup>11</sup> 
                    These experiences shaped me and helped me see the love and care around me, even if it wasn’t like what most people expect.<sup>12</sup> 
                    They gave me the confidence to keep going, believing that better things are still coming.<sup>13</sup> 
                    Life’s challenges and my unusual family made me who I am today.<sup>14</sup> 
                    I’m thankful for the strength and hope those times gave me, and I carry those feelings as I face each new day with optimism.<sup>15</sup>

                <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
                <p>
                    My teenage years were a mix of trying to figure out who I really wanted to be and dealing with the challenges of growing up.<sup>1</sup> 
                    Looking back, there are moments that make me cringe, times when I felt awkward like many teenagers do.<sup>2</sup> 
                    Even though those times were uncomfortable, they were important for me to learn and grow.<sup>3</sup> 
                    Like many teens, I spent a lot of time trying hard to fit in and be seen as <em>cool</em>.<sup>4</sup> 
                    I followed trends, wanted to be liked, and sometimes forgot who I really was.<sup>5</sup> 
                    But after a while, I got tired of pretending to be someone I wasn’t.<sup>6</sup> 
                    Things changed during the pandemic when I turned 15 and was stuck at home with a lot of free time.<sup>7</sup> 
                    Instead of feeling lonely, I used that quiet time to slow down and think about myself and what was important.<sup>8</sup> 
                    Without all the usual distractions of school and friends, I had space to think deeply about my choices and how to be better.<sup>9</sup> 
                    I started learning new things from inside myself, thinking about how I could improve.<sup>10</sup> 
                    That still, quiet time became a big turning point for me.<sup>11</sup> 
                    It helped me become stronger and more confident.<sup>12</sup> 
                    It was a key time that helped build the person I am now and gave me the drive to keep moving forward.<sup>13</sup> 
                    The self-awareness I gained helped me accept who I am, instead of hiding parts of myself.<sup>14</sup> 
                    I started paying more attention to what I really like and who I want to be, instead of just trying to fit in.<sup>15</sup> 
                    This didn’t happen all at once, but step by step.<sup>16</sup> 
                    I learned that growing is something we do all the time, and every experience, good or bad, helps us become stronger.<sup>17</sup> 
                    Overall, my teenage years gave me a strong base for a lifelong journey of learning and accepting myself.<sup>18</sup>

                <h2>College Years</h2>
                <p>
                    College has been an exciting and important part of my life so far.<sup>1</sup> 
                    It’s a time when I keep growing while staying connected to who I was as a teenager.<sup>2</sup> 
                    Many of my values stay the same, but I’ve also learned to accept change and adjust in new ways.<sup>3</sup> 
                    Every experience, whether it’s hard or successful, gives me a chance to think and get better.<sup>4</sup> 
                    I still make mistakes, but now I try to be patient and kind to myself about them.<sup>5</sup> 
                    College has pushed me to leave my comfort zone, meet people from many different backgrounds, and understand myself better.<sup>6</sup> 
                    Meeting new people has helped me see the world in new ways.<sup>7</sup> 
                    This part of life has also encouraged me to keep working toward being a better version of myself every day.<sup>8</sup> 
                    What started as a quiet time of thinking during the pandemic has grown into a constant process of learning and growing.<sup>9</sup> 
                    I’m filled with hope, strength, and believe that no matter where life takes me, I have what I need to face it with confidence and kindness.<sup>10</sup> 
                    College is about more than just school; it’s about learning life lessons and building my future.<sup>11</sup> 
                    I’m thankful for the chance to follow my interests and challenge myself.<sup>12</sup> 
                    This time has made me more committed to always growing and learning.<sup>13</sup> 
                    While I respect my past and what shaped me, I also look forward to what’s next with excitement.<sup>14</sup> 
                    The journey continues, and I’m ready to face whatever comes with an open heart and mind.<sup>15</sup>
